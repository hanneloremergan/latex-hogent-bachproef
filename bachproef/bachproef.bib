  abstract       = {Precision agriculture employs cutting-edge technologies to increase agricultural productivity while reducing adverse impacts on the environment. Precision agriculture is a farming approach that uses advanced technology and data analysis to maximize crop yields, cut waste, and increase productivity. It is a potential strategy for tackling some of the major issues confronting contemporary agriculture, such as feeding a growing world population while reducing environmental effects. This review article examines some of the latest recent advances in precision agriculture, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and how to make use of big data. This review article aims to provide an overview of the recent innovations, challenges, and future prospects of precision agriculture and smart farming. It presents an analysis of the current state of precision agriculture, including the most recent innovations in technology, such as drones, sensors, and machine learning. The article also discusses some of the main challenges faced by precision agriculture, including data management, technology adoption, and cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Agriculture production highly depends on water and soil factors which increasingly need to be utilized efficiently. Precision agriculture, through the set of information technologies that it uses, allows to effectively manage these resources. This work aims to gather the existing knowledge on technologies used in precision agriculture and ways to discern the most appropriate one for different contexts in agricultural processes. A systematic literature review is performed to identify precision agriculture implementations and to answer questions such as the type of technologies used, criteria for their comparison and selection, and the existence of frameworks that help to decide what technologies to implement. A total of 3,949 publications were reviewed, of which 259 addressed the posed research questions. The findings are that remote sensors are the most used technology, the required knowledge is an important criterion for deciding to implement precision agriculture, and no framework was found that guides its implementation.},

  abstract       = {Precision agriculture employs cutting-edge technologies to increase agricultural productivity while reducing adverse impacts on the environment. Precision agriculture is a farming approach that uses advanced technology and data analysis to maximize crop yields, cut waste, and increase productivity. It is a potential strategy for tackling some of the major issues confronting contemporary agriculture, such as feeding a growing world population while reducing environmental effects. This review article examines some of the latest recent advances in precision agriculture, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and how to make use of big data. This review article aims to provide an overview of the recent innovations, challenges, and future prospects of precision agriculture and smart farming. It presents an analysis of the current state of precision agriculture, including the most recent innovations in technology, such as drones, sensors, and machine learning. The article also discusses some of the main challenges faced by precision agriculture, including data management, technology adoption, and cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Agriculture production highly depends on water and soil factors which increasingly need to be utilized efficiently. Precision agriculture, through the set of information technologies that it uses, allows to effectively manage these resources. This work aims to gather the existing knowledge on technologies used in precision agriculture and ways to discern the most appropriate one for different contexts in agricultural processes. A systematic literature review is performed to identify precision agriculture implementations and to answer questions such as the type of technologies used, criteria for their comparison and selection, and the existence of frameworks that help to decide what technologies to implement. A total of 3,949 publications were reviewed, of which 259 addressed the posed research questions. The findings are that remote sensors are the most used technology, the required knowledge is an important criterion for deciding to implement precision agriculture, and no framework was found that guides its implementation.},

  abstract     = {Object detection can be regarded as one of the most fundamental and challenging visual recognition task in computer vision and it has received great attention over the past few decades. Object detection techniques find their application in almost all the spheres of life, most prominent ones being surveillance, autonomous driving, pedestrian detection and so on. The primary focus of visual object detection is to detect objects belonging to certain class targets with absolute localization in a realistic scene or an input image and also to assign each detected instance of an object a predefined class label. Owing to rapid development of deep neural networks, the performance of object detectors has rapidly improved and as a result of this deep learning based detection techniques have been actively studied over the past several years. In this paper we provide a comprehensive survey of latest advances in deep learning based visual object detection. Firstly we have reviewed a large body of recent works in literature and using that we have analyzed traditional and current object detectors. Afterwards and primarily we provide a rigorous overview of backbone architectures for object detection followed by a systematic cover up of current learning strategies. Some popular datasets and metrics used for object detection are analyzed as well. Finally we discuss applications of object detection and provide several future directions to facilitate future research for visual object detection with deep learning.},

  abstract       = {Currently, strawberry harvesting relies heavily on human labour and subjective assessments of ripeness, resulting in inconsistent post-harvest quality. Therefore, the aim of this work is to automate this process and provide a more accurate and efficient way of assessing ripeness. We explored a unique combination of YOLOv7 object detection and augmented reality technology to detect and visualise the ripeness of strawberries. Our results showed that the proposed YOLOv7 object detection model, which employed transfer learning, fine-tuning and multi-scale training, accurately identified the level of ripeness of each strawberry with an mAP of 0.89 and an F1 score of 0.92. The tiny models have an average detection time of 18 ms per frame at a resolution of 1280 × 720 using a high-performance computer, thereby enabling real-time detection in the field. Our findings distinctly establish the superior performance of YOLOv7 when compared to other cutting-edge methodologies. We also suggest using Microsoft HoloLens 2 to overlay predicted ripeness labels onto each strawberry in the real world, providing a visual representation of the ripeness level. Despite some challenges, this work highlights the potential of augmented reality to assist farmers in harvesting support, which could have significant implications for current agricultural practices.},
